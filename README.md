# Mini-Project
Opencv Based real-time Traffic Analyzer

This is a Project me and my friend developed for a hackathon contest.
It uses opencv-python for object detection and trackng and assigns a unique id to it.
It Writes the vehicle count as it detects to an output file, which is read by the JS script, 
and a very simple web page to update the number of vehicles real-time.


# To Use : (For Testing)

Run a simple python server from the cloned repo ,
Setup an ngrok session to host it on the internet .
